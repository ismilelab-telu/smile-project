# Git Commit

## Overview

Inspect the working tree, choose a staging strategy (add all vs split by diff), run required validation commands, and create conventional commits. Do not push.

## Quick Workflow

1. Confirm repository state.
   Run:

```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Optional helper:

```bash
.agents/skills/git-commit/scripts/diff-summary.sh
```

2. Choose a staging strategy from the diff.
   Pick the narrowest staging approach that keeps each commit to a single “why”.

Decision guide:

- Use **add-all** when everything is one coherent concern (a single feature/fix/refactor) and the commit message won’t need “and”.
- Use **add by paths** when the changes are multiple concerns but cleanly separated by files/folders.
- Use **add interactively (`-p`)** when different concerns are mixed within the same file (common with formatting + logic, refactor + fix, etc.).

3. Stage changes.

Add-all strategy:

```bash
git add -A
```

Split-by-path strategy (repeat per logical commit):

```bash
git add <paths>
git diff --cached
```

Split-by-hunk strategy (repeat per logical commit):

```bash
git add -p
# or: git add -p <path>
git diff --cached
```

If you staged too much:

```bash
git restore --staged <paths>
```

4. Run required validation before each commit.
   Always follow repository-level agent instructions first (for example `AGENTS.md`) and run the required validator command.
   If the repository exposes a canonical validation command such as `vp check`, prefer that command first.
   If the repository routes tooling through a wrapper CLI, prefer that CLI directly over package-script wrappers and raw upstream commands. For example, use `vp check` or `vp test run` when VitePlus is the canonical toolchain.
   If repo instructions and package scripts appear to conflict, treat raw tool commands in docs as potentially stale and verify the canonical command entrypoint before committing.
   Default when no repo-specific override exists:

```bash
npx oxlint <paths> --fix && npx tsc -b --noEmit
```

Use the staged paths where practical. If the staged set is large or mixed, use broader paths that cover the staged files.

5. Commit with a conventional commit message.
   Use:

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): subject"
```

For multiline messages (subject + body), prefer a heredoc so the body stays readable and compact:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject

Why (intent/context)
What changed (high-level)
Notes (migrations, flags, follow-ups)
EOF
```

For longer bodies, prefer the editor:

```bash
git commit
```

## Multiline Commit Message Guidance

Default to a body when the diff is non-trivial, when intent is not obvious, or when follow-up actions are required.

Keep the body short and outcome-focused:

- Start with why, not how.
- Call out important side effects or constraints.
- Mention migrations, flags, or manual steps when relevant.
- Wrap each body line to satisfy commitlint limits (commonly `body-max-line-length: 100`).
- If a line is too long, split it into additional `What:` / `Notes:` lines instead of cramming details.

Recommended body shape (2–6 short lines):

- Why: user/business intent, bug cause, or constraint
- What: key changes at a high level
- Notes: migrations, flags, follow-ups (if any)

Example:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'EOF'
feat(auth): enforce session timeout

Why: invalidate sessions after 30m inactivity to meet compliance requirements.
What: enforce timeout server-side and surface expiration to clients.
EOF
```

If commitlint fails with a body line-length error, re-run commit with wrapped lines, for example:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'EOF'
chore(tooling): upgrade vite and react plugin beta

Why: align build tooling with Vite 8 beta and avoid no-test run failures.
What: replace rolldown-vite alias with vite@8.0.0-beta.16.
What: switch to @vitejs/plugin-react@6.0.0-beta.0 and refresh lockfile.
EOF
```

## Commit Strategy Guidance

Prefer the smallest number of commits that preserves clarity.

Signals to split:

- Multiple top-level areas changed with different intent.
- Mixed change types (e.g., `feat` + `fix` + `refactor`).
- A commit message would need "and".

Practical split patterns:

- By concern: feature, bugfix, refactor, docs, tests.
- By area: backend vs frontend, or by module/directory.

## Conventional Commit Heuristics

Choose the narrowest correct type:

- `feat`: new behavior or user-visible capability
- `fix`: bug fix or behavior correction
- `refactor`: internal change without behavior change
- `docs`: documentation only
- `test`: tests only
- `chore`: tooling, config, maintenance

Scope:

- Derive from the most relevant top-level folder or bounded module.
- Keep it short and stable (e.g., `auth`, `orders`, `ui`, `api`).

Subject:

- Imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period.
- Describe outcome, not implementation detail.

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add session timeout enforcement`
- `fix(api): handle empty batch payload`
- `refactor(ui): simplify invoice table columns`

## Safety Rules

Do:

- Inspect diffs before staging and before committing.
- Use `git diff --cached` to verify the staged set.
- Create multiple commits when it increases clarity.
- Stop after commit. Do not push.

Do not:

- Use destructive git commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`).
- Rewrite history unless explicitly asked.
